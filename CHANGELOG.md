0.4.1
=====
- Transaction amounts on the on-screen payments list now use the MicroPythonOS NumberFormat thousands separator, matching the balance label's style (e.g. balance "₿8,984" + transaction "₿8,984: Apr 9 confirmed" — previously the transaction showed bare "8984"). Honours the user's `number_format` preference (US comma_dot, European dot_comma, Swiss apos_dot, French space_comma, etc.). Falls back to bare `str()` on pre-0.9.1 firmware
- Rename the "₿ sats" denomination's internal value from the cryptic `"symbol"` to `"₿ symbol"` (matching the visible picker label) so the Customise → Balance Denomination row reads cleanly. Includes a one-shot migration in `DisplayWallet.onCreate`: anyone with the old `"symbol"` value in prefs is auto-converted to `"₿ symbol"` on next launch (idempotent — no-op on subsequent boots and for users who never used the symbol mode)
- Transactions area now scrolls in-place when it has more entries than fit on screen. Previously a long zap comment or a long list of payments dragged the WHOLE screen (balance + QR + hero + transactions) into scroll mode, which was disorienting. Now only the transactions list scrolls; the balance, QR, hero, and settings cog stay put. The scrollbar itself is hidden — the area is still scrollable via touch drag, the few pixels the AUTO scrollbar used to reserve are reclaimed for transaction text
- Auto-scroll the transactions area to the top on every new transaction. If the user had previously scrolled down to inspect older entries, the list animates back to the top when the wallet emits a new payment — same "look, something new arrived" cue as the confetti for balance changes. No-op when already at top
- Auto-scroll the transactions area to the top after 2 minutes of no screen contact. If the user scrolls down to inspect older transactions and then walks away, the device naturally re-presents the most recent transactions to the next person who looks. Tracks any touch on any interactive widget (LVGL 9 events don't bubble to ancestors by default, so the contact tracker is registered on each widget directly)
- Balance label tap target enlarged from 224×29 to 224×45 px — 55 % more area. Below the Material Design 48 px minimum but as large as fits without overlapping the transactions area. The visible text rendering is unchanged; only the (invisible) click region grew downward to the line under the balance. Fixes "tapping balance to cycle denomination is hard on hardware"

0.4.0
=====
- Per-wallet-type cache: balance, transactions, and receive QR paint instantly on app open / re-entry for each configured wallet (LNBits and NWC each get their own cached slot). Previously the cache was write-only and the screen started blank on every launch until the first network fetch landed
- Fingerprint-guarded cache invalidation: changing credential settings (LNBits URL / read key, NWC URL) wipes that slot's cached data so the next paint waits for fresh fetches. Changing just the optional LN-address override invalidates only the cached QR, keeping cached balance and transactions on-screen
- Stale-data indicator: a small dot appears beneath the mascot when the wallet has produced only errors for a sustained period. Two tiers — orange after 10 minutes of failures (data might be slightly behind) and red after 60 minutes (definitely old). Cleared automatically on the next successful refresh
- Cache file format bumped to v2; any existing v1 cache file is silently discarded on first launch

0.3.2
=====
- Fix payment list never refreshing on budgeted NWC connections (e.g. Primal/Spark, Alby with a spend budget). The NWC main loop only triggered `fetch_payments` when `handle_new_balance` saw the balance change — but on budgeted connections `get_balance` returns the connection's spend budget (locked at the value chosen during NWC setup), so the balance never moves and the transaction list was fetched only once on initial connect and then frozen forever. Now polls `list_transactions` every cycle alongside `fetch_balance`, so newly received payments appear within ≤120 s regardless of whether the displayed balance moves

0.3.1
=====
- Fix LNBits wallet silently dying after a single `fetch_static_receive_code` network error. The call sits in the main poll loop but was not guarded by a try/except like `fetch_balance` — any 5xx / timeout / DNS glitch tore the task out of its `while self.keep_running:` and no code restarted it, so the wallet appeared frozen until the user reopened the app. Now wraps the fetch the same way as the balance path, surfaces the error via `handle_error`, and continues on the next cycle

0.3.0
=====
- Light/Dark theme toggle in Customise settings — app-local override that doesn't touch the OS-level theme; other apps and the launcher keep the user's OS preference
- Dark mode uses pure black (#000) for the main display, settings screens, and the fullscreen QR view (previously a dark charcoal); keeps all surfaces consistent with the QR code backdrop
- Editing wallet config in Settings now actually switches the running wallet. Previous behaviour kept the old wallet polling silently; balance/transactions/QR on screen wouldn't match the edited credentials until an app restart
- Switching wallets no longer shows stale data for a few seconds — previously the old balance (re-animated for 15 s), old transactions (from cached previous-wallet data), and old QR code (widget not hidden on swap) would linger before the new wallet's fetch completed
- Switching wallets no longer exhausts the ESP32 TCP socket pool: `NWCWallet.stop()` and `LNBitsWallet.stop()` now eagerly close relay websockets / payment-notification websockets, and the new wallet's startup waits for the old one's sockets to release before opening its own (fixes "Could not connect to any Nostr Wallet Connect relays" on quick swaps)
- Scrub three more secret-leak paths: the `wallet config changed` log line (leaked URLs/secret/readkey during restarts) and three `RuntimeError` messages in `LNBitsWallet.fetch_*` methods (leaked the readkey to the on-screen error label when a fetch failed)
- Remove dead send_button code (pre-multi-wallet placeholder that never shipped) and its orphan tap handler
- Guard the payments_updated_cb callback against a missing assignment (consistency with the peer callbacks)
- Correct a misleading comment that claimed wallet callbacks run "on another thread" — they actually run on the same event loop as LVGL via TaskManager.create_task
- Security: scrub NWC URL, secret, and pubkey from debug logs. The Nostr Wallet Connect secret authorises spending; prior builds printed it to serial/REPL during `parse_nwc_url()`, so any shared debug output exposed wallet control. Redacted eight leak points (full URL, post-prefix URL, url-decoded URL, raw query string containing `secret=`, extracted secret, extracted pubkey, parsed-summary line, and RuntimeError message).
